summary     : Asynchronous input/output library that uses the Linux kernel's native interfaces
description : |
    AIO enables even a single application thread to overlap I/O operations with other
    processing, by providing an interface for submitting one or more I/O requests in
    one system call (io_submit()) without waiting for completion, and a separate interface
    (io_getevents()) to reap completed I/O operations associated with a given completion
    group. Support for kernel AIO has been available since Linux-2.6.
