# venom

Early bringup recipes intended to demonstrate fitness for purpose of the Serpent OS tooling.

This is a draft repo which will be deleted at some point in the not too distant future. Plan accordingly and don't get too attached to your work here.

## Scope

Now that the official Serpent OS infra is up, working recipes should be PRed to the [main repository](https://github.com/snekpit/venom), thus leaving venom strictly as a showcase for recipes which demonstrate bugs and misfeatures with the intent of generating bug fixes/feature requests + PRs related to the tooling.

If you encounter specific issues with moss or boulder, report them first in the Development matrix channel in our [matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/!trFJOzhpDUejJKnPYg:matrix.org) and then go from there in terms of potentially capturing issues for the relevant tool in their respective code repos.

### Recipe tree structure

The goal is to be inspired by the [SolusOS2](https://github.com/SolusOS-discontinued/packages) organisation and the [Exherbo git monorepo trees](https://git.exherbo.org/) and see where that gets us.

Note that `base/` is reserved for critical, self-hosting systemd-nspawn container stuff that must always be in working order. A good example would be `readline`, because shells and compilers included in the self-hosting systemd-nspawn containers set rely on it.

We're going to aim for consensus decisions to begin with, so everyone is expected to keep things civil. That said, if the BDFL chips in, his decisions take precedence.

## Documentation

As the state of the tooling is still in flux, the best thing to do to get an idea for how things work is to look at the recipes in the [main snekpit recipe repo](https://github.com/snekpit/main).

The other thing to do is to look at the macro `%actions` and `%(definitions)` in the [boulder code repo](https://github.com/serpent-os/boulder/tree/main/data/macros).

The naming of concepts has been tweaked compared to what some of you might be used to, with the primary purpose being more sensible and clear semantics in terms of natural speech and its supporting mental models.

Additionally, it might be worth pointing out that _this is not $otheros!_

You are encouraged to forget everything you thought you knew about how things are supposed to work and be open to the different goals of Serpent OS which spawned the tooling you're about to use.  The fully fleshed out workflow is also not yet ready for you to use, so things will feel rather manual initially.

### How to get started writing a recipe

To get a basic recipe, use `boulder new -h` to get started.

Thanks to work done by our contributors, [git upstreams](https://github.com/serpent-os/boulder/issues/25) can now be used in recipes .

### The recipe `pkg/` dir and `%(pkgdir)`

Place extra files such as patches, vendor configs etc. in the `pkg/` dir inside the  recipe dir.  Files inside `pkg/` will automatically be copied over to  `%(pkgdir)` during boulder builds, from where each can be referenced as `%(pkgdir)/path/filename` in the recipe.  The directory name `pkg/` was chosen because it's short and stands out in `tree` invocations.

### What to commit

    git add stone.yml manifest.x86_64.bin manifest.x86_64.jsonc

- `manifest.x86_64.bin` Binary moss readable file used to create moss collection stone.index files for dep resolution etc.
- `manifest.x86_64.jsonc` Human readable version of manifest.bin used for git diff introspection purposes
- `stone.yml` The actual build recipe

### Commit messages

Use a `category/pkg: verb <foo>` format with one commit per package change.

Example: `shells/fish: Add vX.Y` or `shells/fish: Update to vX.Y` or `shells/fish: Fix (...)`

Bump release for functional recipe changes only; do not bump release for no functional change commits (documentation typos, formatting).

No functional change commits use the [NFC] tag: `shells/fish: [NFC] Tweak comments`.

### Recipe licensing

We only accept Zlib licensed code and recipe contributions due to Zlib's uncomplicated nature. `boulder new` has been updated to use a REUSE compliant Zlib header, but existing recipes will need to be updated with the following REUSE-compliant verbiage at the top:
