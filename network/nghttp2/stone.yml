summary     : C implementation of the HTTP/2.0 protocol
description : |
   nghttp2 is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C.

    The framing layer of HTTP/2 is implemented as a reusable C library. On top of that, we have implemented an HTTP/2 client, server and proxy. We have also developed load test and benchmarking tools for HTTP/2.
